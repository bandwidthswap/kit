# Bandwidth Swap kit

The code for the Phase 0 lab: three Raspberry Pi 3 B nodes on a home LAN that keep time, tunnel traffic and sign receipts. The site, the paper and the backlog are in [bandwidthswap.github.io](https://github.com/bandwidthswap/bandwidthswap.github.io); this repo is what runs on the nodes.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `bwkit.py` | The receipt daemon and the Mint, one file. Python 3.9+ and `python3-cryptography`. |
| `test_bwkit.py` | Runs a payer, a hop and a Mint in one process. `python3 test_bwkit.py` |
| `install.sh` | Installs `bwkit` on one node: `sudo ./install.sh payer\|hop\|mint` |
| `systemd/` | The hop's and Mint's service, the payer's hourly timer. |
| `phase0/provision.sh` | The whole lab from the Mac over SSH: upgrade, chrony, WireGuard, logs to RAM, bwkit. |
| `phase0/dispute-test.sh [hop\|payer]` | The dispute tests from the Mac: an agreeing window, then one where one side's counters restart mid-window. `hop` (the default) is the hop under-claiming, `payer` the hop over-claiming; the Mint settles both at the smaller count. |
| `phase0/clock-test.sh` | The clock rule from the Mac: `bw-forest`'s clock stepped 10 s ahead, a receipt the hop declines, chrony restored, a receipt that settles. |

## What a receipt is

The paper's Figure 2, exactly:

```
(payer NYM, hop NYM, hop index, merkle root, bytes, t_first, t_last, prev receipt sig)  signed by payer
```

A NYM is an ed25519 public key (`ed25519:` and the key, base64url). The signed bytes are the eight fields as a JSON array in that order, prefixed with `bandwidthswap/receipt/v1\n`. Timestamps are the payer's, in Unix seconds, because the payer's clock is authoritative (paper 3.5).

Phase 0 has two nodes on a tunnel and nothing chunked, so:

- `merkle_root` is the payer's SHA-256 commitment to its own meter readings for the window (counters at `t_first` and `t_last`). It stands in for the Merkle root over payload chunks until there is a chunked data plane.
- The window is an hour. The payer's receipt counts the bytes that crossed its `wg0` in that hour, both directions.

Every hour, `bw-house` (the payer) signs its receipt and asks `bw-forest` (the hop) to acknowledge it. The hop checks the signature and the payer's clock (5 seconds, decline: backlog B9), reads its own `wg0` counters for the same window, and signs the same tuple with **its own** byte count and `prev_sig` set to the payer's signature. When the counts agree that is the countersignature that closes the chain. When they don't, it is the dispute, in the same format.

Both go to `bw-mint`. The Mint checks every signature, refuses NYMs it was not told about, appends each receipt and ack to `ledger.jsonl` (append only, nothing is ever rewritten), and once it holds both halves of a window writes a settlement:

```
settled_bytes = min(payer's count, hop's count)
```

Neither party is bound beyond what it signed: the payer never pays for more than it committed to, the hop is never paid for more than it acknowledged. The settlement says `settled` when the two counts are within 1% (or 64 KiB) of each other, `disputed` otherwise, and the rule is the same in both cases. `bwkit settle receipt.json ack.json` does the same computation offline from the two files, which is the pilot's test: a dispute resolves from the receipt data alone.

Dollars, not tokens: the Mint prices settled bytes at `price_usd_per_gb` from its config (the lab's posted price, 10 cents a gigabyte) and `bwkit invoice 2026-10` sums a month. There is no payment rail; the invoice is the pilot's settlement (backlog E, B8 default d).

## Running it

On a node, as root, from a checkout:

```
sudo ./install.sh payer     # bw-house
sudo ./install.sh hop       # bw-forest
sudo ./install.sh mint      # bw-mint
```

That installs `/usr/local/bin/bwkit`, the `bwkit` system user, `/var/lib/bwkit` (key, peers, state, ledger, outbox) and a first `/etc/bwkit/config.json` for the role. Then, once, tell every node the others' NYMs (`bwkit nym` prints a node's own):

```
sudo -u bwkit bwkit peer add bw-house  ed25519:...
sudo -u bwkit bwkit peer add bw-forest ed25519:...
```

Start the servers on the hop and the Mint, take the baseline sample on the payer and the hop at the same moment (the first window starts there), and enable the payer's timer:

```
sudo systemctl enable --now bwkit               # bw-forest and bw-mint
sudo -u bwkit bwkit sample                      # bw-house and bw-forest
sudo systemctl enable --now bwkit-receipt.timer # bw-house
```

`phase0/provision.sh kit` does all of that from the Mac. The first receipt comes at the top of the next hour; `sudo -u bwkit bwkit receipt` on `bw-house` makes one now.

Looking at it:

```
curl -s http://bw-mint.local:8710/status     # counts, pending halves
curl -s http://bw-mint.local:8710/ledger     # the ledger, one JSON object per line
sudo -u bwkit bwkit ledger [--disputes]      # on bw-mint, readable
sudo -u bwkit bwkit invoice 2026-10          # on bw-mint
sudo -u bwkit bwkit status                   # on any node
journalctl -u bwkit -u bwkit-receipt -f      # the daemon's log
```

Config (`/etc/bwkit/config.json`):

| Key | Who | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `role` | all | `payer`, `hop` or `mint` |
| `name` | all | The node's name on the ledger; the hostname by default |
| `iface` | payer, hop | The metered interface, `wg0`. `file:/path.json` with `{"rx","tx"}` is the test meter. |
| `hop_name`, `hop_url` | payer | The hop to ask for acks, by its peers.json name and its URL on the tunnel |
| `mint` | payer, hop | The Mint's URL |
| `port` | hop, mint | Listen port, 8710 |
| `price_usd_per_gb` | mint | The posted price |

What is deliberately not here: prepayment of a window (backlog B2 b), a payment rail, more than one hop, onion routing, a token, a chain. The outbox means a node that cannot reach the Mint keeps its receipts and sends them next hour; a hop that was down for a window acks the next one with both windows' bytes, and the Mint settles that window at the payer's count, so the hop loses the window it missed. The HTTP is plain, on a private LAN; the signatures are what protect the receipts.

## Keys

`install.sh` makes each node's ed25519 key in `/var/lib/bwkit/key.priv` (mode 600, owner `bwkit`). WireGuard keys are made on the nodes by `provision.sh` and stay in `/etc/wireguard`. Nothing in this repo is secret and nothing secret should be added to it.
